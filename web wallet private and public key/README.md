3. **View the welcome screen** with the create wallet button
4. **Implement the JavaScript functionality** as needed

## Implementation Notes

The JavaScript file (`js/wallet.js`) contains only the structure and placeholder functions. To make the wallet functional, you'll need to implement:

- **Key Generation**: Cryptographic key pair generation

- **Clipboard Operations**: Copy functionality for keys
- **State Management**: Show/hide wallet sections
- **Data Persistence**: Secure storage of wallet data
- **Export Functionality**: Download wallet information

## Security Considerations

When implementing the wallet functionality, consider:

- ✅ Use secure random number generation
- ✅ Implement proper key derivation functions
- ✅ Never store private keys in plain text
- ✅ Consider hardware wallet integration
- ✅ Implement proper session management
- ✅ Use HTTPS in production

## Browser Support

- ✅ Chrome (latest)
- ✅ Firefox (latest)
- ✅ Safari (latest)
- ✅ Edge (latest)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## CSS Features Used

- CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- CSS Custom Properties (variables)
- Backdrop-filter for glassmorphism
- CSS Animations and Transitions
- Modern CSS selectors and pseudo-elements
- Responsive design with media queries

## Customization

The wallet can be easily customized by modifying:

- **Colors**: Update CSS custom properties in `style.css`
- **Fonts**: Change the Google Fonts import in `index.html`
